## Introduction

CameraX is a Jetpack library introduced by Google to simplify camera functionalities in Android apps. It offers an easy-to-use API that works consistently across a wide range of devices. Jetpack Compose is Android's modern UI toolkit that simplifies UI development with a declarative approach. This guide combines these two powerful tools to create responsive and modern camera applications.

## Understanding CameraX

CameraX is part of the Android Jetpack family, built on top of the Camera2 API but with a more straightforward API. Key features include:

- **Backward Compatibility**: Works on Android 5.0 (API level 21) and higher.
- **Simple Configuration**: Easy setup with default configurations.
- **Lifecycle-Aware**: Automatically handles lifecycle events.
- **Extensibility**: Supports use cases like Preview, ImageCapture, and ImageAnalysis.
- **Device Support**: Ensures consistent behavior across different Android devices.

## Setting Up CameraX in Your Project

To use CameraX in your project, add the following dependencies to your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.camera:camera-core:<latest-version>"
    implementation "androidx.camera:camera-camera2:<latest-version>"
    implementation "androidx.camera:camera-lifecycle:<latest-version>"
    implementation "androidx.camera:camera-view:<latest-version>"
    implementation "androidx.camera:camera-extensions:<latest-version>"
}
```

Ensure your project uses AndroidX and Kotlin, as CameraX and Jetpack Compose are part of the Android Jetpack suite.

## Integrating CameraX with Jetpack Compose

CameraX traditionally uses a `CameraView` in XML layouts. With Jetpack Compose, we use `AndroidView` to embed the CameraX `PreviewView` within a Compose layout.

## Example: Camera Preview with Jetpack Compose

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to set up a camera preview using CameraX and Jetpack Compose.

### Code Overview

The code provided in this repository includes:

- **Camera Preview Screen**: Displays the camera feed and provides options to capture images.
- **Saving Options**: Users can choose to save images to internal storage, MediaStore, via a `FileProvider` URI, or as a temporary file.
- **Permissions Handling**: Manages camera permissions and lifecycle events.

## Code Explanation

The example includes detailed explanations of the following components:

1. **MainActivity**: Handles camera permissions and sets up the content view with `CameraPreviewScreen`.
2. **CameraPreviewScreen**: Displays the camera preview and UI controls for capturing images.
3. **Radio Buttons**: Allows users to select different saving options for captured images.
4. **Capture Image Button**: Triggers the image capture process, displaying success or error messages.

## Conclusion

By combining CameraX with Jetpack Compose, Android developers can create powerful and modern camera applications with a user-friendly UI. This repository serves as a practical example to help you get started with these technologies.
